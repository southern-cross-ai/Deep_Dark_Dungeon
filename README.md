## 🏰 Introduction

The primary purpose of this project is to develop **"The Guild,"** a **free-to-play** game designed using **Unreal Engine 5** for both **PC and mobile platforms**. 

The game is conceptualized and led by an **experienced tutor from the TechLauncher program**, who is also a **veteran game developer**. "The Guild" aims to create an engaging **fantasy base-building simulation** that combines elements from popular games like **Fallout Shelter** and **Darkest Dungeon**.

### 🎭 **Game Concept**
- **Guild Master Role**: Players take on the role of a **guild master**, responsible for building and decorating their guild base.
- **Adventurer System**: Recruit, train, and manage a team of adventurers.
- **Exploration & Missions**: Send adventurers on **various quests**, manage their progress, and tackle challenges.
- **Expansive Overmap**: Explore **dungeons, biomes, and contracts** across a procedurally generated world.
- **AI-Generated Events**: **Dynamically generated text-based encounters** enrich the gameplay with immersive storytelling.

**🔹 Our goal** is to create a unique blend of **strategic base management, adventure, and exploration** to appeal to both **casual** and **hardcore gamers** on **PC and mobile**.
