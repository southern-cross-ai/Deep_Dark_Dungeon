ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ Who Am I? ヾ(•ω•`)o
A self-proclaimed Dungeon Architect 🏰, Code Gremlin 🧙‍♂️, and Bug Whisperer 🐛. Currently lost in the dark dungeons of Unreal Engine 5, trying to make things look cool without melting my GPU. If it compiles, it’s a miracle. If it runs, it’s a blessing. If it doesn’t crash… well, that’s sorcery.

🛠 What Am I Doing? (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

🎮 UE5 Game Dev – Making dungeons scarier, enemies dumber, and the game loop actually work (sometimes).
🧩 Blueprint Sorcery – Because who needs logic when you have spaghetti nodes? 🍝💀
🎨 Low-Poly Crimes – My models have less polygons than my patience. It’s stylized, okay?!
🔧 Optimization Struggles – If it runs at 30 FPS, that’s cinematic. If it runs at 60 FPS, I must have made a mistake.
