## Week 4: Code Review and Project Cleanup Planning

### âœ… Code Review
- Completed individual and group reviews of the three systems mentioned above.
- Verified:
  - Code structure and logic consistency
  - Compatibility with current development goals
  - Areas that require refactoring or simplification

### ðŸ“Š Review Outcome
- Noted large volumes of **unused assets** across all systems (textures, meshes, placeholder scripts).
- Identified **performance bottlenecks** related to redundant actors, logic loops, and unoptimized assets.

### ðŸ§¼ Planning Cleanup and Instance System
- Decided that Week 5 would focus on:
  - **Cleaning up the project** to reduce storage and performance overhead.
  - **Investigating ways to add storage systems (instances)** per gameplay system.
    - Problem: Storage space usage is too high due to legacy clutter.
    - Solution: Systematic cleanup and modular structuring before instance implementation.
