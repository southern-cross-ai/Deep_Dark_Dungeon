## Week 5: Project Cleanup and Blueprint-Only Transition

### 🔁 Transition to Blueprint-Only Project
- To improve maintainability and reduce technical complexity:
  - Fully converted the hybrid **C++/Blueprint project** to a **Blueprint-only project**.
  - Facilitated better onboarding and debugging for all team members.

### 🧹 Cleanup Completed
- Deleted unused assets and scripts.
- Optimized scene hierarchies, actor references, and material setups.
- Reduced the overall project size significantly.

### ⚠️ Limitation Identified
- Found that **instance system integration** could not proceed until all systems were fully merged and standardized.
  - Action deferred to post-merge.

### 🔀 System Merge Initiated
- Started merging the three gameplay systems into the **main branch**.
- Ensured all prior changes were integrated and tested in individual branches before merging.
- Coordinated timeline to finish merging before Week 6.

### 🧾 Sprint Documentation
- Started compiling:
  - **Team communication records** (Discord logs, meeting notes)
  - **Task documentation**
  - **Progress evidence** for Sprint review
  - Prepared items for final showcase and tutor review.
